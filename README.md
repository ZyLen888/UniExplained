# Stepla: UniExplained

Style inspired by this amazing website [Short Links with Superpowers](https://dub.sh/)

## üß† Thoughts

Being a co-founder of Stepla, an online community and platform to bridge high school students with university experiences, during a discussion with fellow co-founders, we were brainstorming how to make high school students transition into uni as smooth as possible. One problem we identified is that high school students found it daunting to look into university documents, handbooks, and relevant pages because of the overwhelming information shown. So we wondered if there is a way to summarise, simplify and explain the page better. 

## üí™ Action

So thinking of the power of OpenAI, I thought, why not try to use their API and see what I can make out of it? Then voila, here is an explainer / summariser that I built with OpenAI API. A link can be entered in the input box, which will return a summarised, explained version of the web page entered. 

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Result

Due to the price of one of the APIs I am using now, **I have decided to currently withhold the link from being publicly published**.   

Otherwise, if the API requests bumps on and exceed the amount I signed up for, I will be receiving a crazy bill... üí∞   

#### But if you are interested in the project, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhenliumeimiliu/), and I can show a demo to you!

## üõ£ Future Plan

**This is a project in progress**, starting with a simple interface and one input row to enter a link, I will continue to add more features to it!

**Plan:** 
- Find a less expensive API to replace one of the current APIs I am using to extract text from the link provided
- Refine the prompt given to OpenAI API, hoping to receive responses with simpler, more high-schoolers friendly language! 
- Solve the issue with pages with more complex structure, hence resulting in poor outcome of explanation (ex. handbook with multiple column and buttons)
